    "My implementation uses two classes for Tree and Node. The main purpose of Object-Oriented Programming is to manage tasks more effectively, divide them into tangible parts, and manage data efficiently. Some of the methods in the assignment require traversal through the trie tree, and it is more effective to handle it inside a separate Tree class. Class Node stores data about the nodes and gets called during insertion and initialization steps. Separation from the class Tree ensures all nodes do not get changed accidentally in the methods. Tree class contains methods and modifies the trie. Debugging is also easier with two classes, as an error in a method does not cause any problems in the Node class. The Node class is independent, and many methods can be added to the Tree without any errors on the Node class end. Further, separation makes data easier to navigate, creating a division between what is necessary for methods and the node itself.  "

    "In the two cells below, there are two code skeletons. Depending on your answer to Q1a, either **implement a Node and a Trie class** or **implement a Node class**. Choose the corresponding code cell and delete the other one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your class(es), write **insert()** and **lookup()** methods, which will insert a word into the trie tree and look it up, respectively. Use the code skeleton and examine the specifications of its docstrings to guide you on the details of inputs and outputs to each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are coding two classes, your Trie should, upon initiation, create the root Node. If you are coding a single class, use an attribute to mark the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, make sure that the trie can be **initiated with a wordbank as an input**. This means that a user can create a trie and feed it an initial dictionary of words at the same time (like in the tests below), which will be automatically inserted into the trie upon its creation. Likely, this will mean that your \\_\\_init\\_\\_() has to make some calls to your insert() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several test cases have been provided for your convenience and these include some, but not all, possible edge cases. If the implementation is correct, your code will pass all the tests. In addition, create at least **three more tests** to demonstrate that your code is working correctly and justify why such test cases are appropriate."

In total, time complexity goes down to T(n)= O(1)+ O(len(word))+ O(len(word)*1) +O(1) --> O(len(word)).

Time complexity is explained by the algorithm that goes down the tree either to the right or left subtree depending on the given value.Similarly to insert method in BSTs, worst-case is O(n), where the tree is completely unbalanced (all nodes are in one branch of the tree) and average and best cases are O(log n), when the tree is perfectly or almost perfectly-balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion is faster for the trie trees, as its time complexity only depends on the length of the word, whereas BSTs consider the total height of the tree for time complexity. Similarly, searching a word in the trie tree only takes O(len(word)) time, while BST requires comparisons with other nodes and O(h) time. However, a disadvantage of trie trees is memory complexity, as every letter of the word is stored individually. The disadvantage, nevetheless, might be helpful for storing data in cases when a lot of words have the same prefix: **comp**uter, **comp**utational, **comp**romise, **comp**ile, **comp**ute.\n",

However, since we are only interested in the actual words, we would not include \"D\" and \"AR\" in our list.

    "To mathematically determine the overall connotation of a speech, you might want to compute which words are most frequently used and then run a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis). To this end, add a method to your code, **k_most_common()** that will take as an input k, an integer, and return a list of the k most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you’re confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you don’t have to bother with resolving ties (for example, if k = 1, but there are two most common words with the same frequency, you can return either of them), but consider it an extra challenge and let us know if you believe you managed to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cell below downloads and preprocesses several real-world speeches, and then runs the k-most-common word analysis of them; your code should pass the tests. As usual, add at least **three more tests**, and justify why they are relevant to your code (feel free to find more speeches to start analysing too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, copy-paste your previous code and make adjustments to this \"new version\". The first cell has been locked to stop you from accidentally deleting the docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this question well will help you to tackle Q5!\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Hint: This task will probably require your nodes to store more information about the frequency of words inserted into the tree. One data structure that might be very useful to tackle the problem of traversing the tree and finding most common words is heaps — you are allowed to use the heapq library or another alternative for this task.)*"

    "#case1 -- Biden's speech about COVID-19\n",
    "biden_speech=\"\"\"Good morning, everyone.  As I’ve said before, we have the tools to beat COVID — \n",
    "COVID-19 — if we come together as a country and use the tools we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier this month, I laid out a six-part plan for the fall that does just that:\n",
    "One, vaccinate the unvaccinated, including with new requirements; two, keep \n",
    "vaccinated — keep the vaccinated protected; three, keep children safe and \n",
    "schools open; four, increase testing and masking; five, protect the economic — \n",
    "our economic recovery; and six, improve the care for people with COVID-19.  Now,\n",
    "we’ve made important progress on each front.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this week, as planned, we took a key step in protecting the vaccinated with \n",
    "booster shots, which our top government doctors believe provides the highest \n",
    "level of protection available to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Food and Drug Administration — the FDA — the Centers for Disease Control and\n",
    "Prevention — the CDC — they’ve completed their independent scientific review.  \n",
    "And based on that review, the majority of Americans who were fully vaccinated \n",
    "with the Pfizer vaccine are now able to receive the booster shot six months \n",
    "after they’ve received their second shot.  Six months after you receive the \n",
    "second shot, you’re eligible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those eligible include, in addition to meeting the requirement of six months \n",
    "after the second shot: those people that are 65 years old or older; adults 18 \n",
    "and over with certain underlying health conditions like diabetes and obesity; \n",
    "and those who are at increased risk of COVID-19 because of where they work or \n",
    "where they live, like healthcare workers, teachers, grocery store workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s over — that group makes up 60 million Americans who are now eligible for \n",
    "a booster six months after their second shot.  And up to 20 million who will \n",
    "receive their — received their earlier Pfizer shot at least six months ago are \n",
    "eligible today.  So, those January, February — those folks are eligible now.  \n",
    "Now.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I’ve made clear all along: The decision of which booster shot to give, when \n",
    "to start the shot, and who will get them is left to the scientists and the \n",
    "doctors.  That’s what happened here.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while we waited and prepared, we brought enough — we bought enough booster \n",
    "shots, and states and pharmacies, doctor’s offices, and community health centers\n",
    "have been preparing to get shots in arms — booster shots in arms — for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "And like your first and second shot, the booster shot is free and easily \n",
    "accessible.  Booster shots will be available in 80,000 locations, including over\n",
    "40,000 pharmacies nationwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, my message today is this: If you’ve got the Pfizer vaccine — if you got the \n",
    "Pfizer vaccine in January, February, or March of this year and you’re over 65 \n",
    "years of age, go get the booster.   Or if you have a medical condition like \n",
    "diabetes or you’re a frontline worker, like a healthcare worker or a teacher, \n",
    "you can get a free booster now.  I’ll be getting my booster shot.  It’s hard to \n",
    "acknowledge I’m over 65, but I’ll be getting my booster shot.  (Laughter.)  It’s\n",
    "a bear, isn’t it?  I tell you — acknowledge it.  Anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all kidding aside, I’ll be getting my booster shot.  I’m not sure exactly \n",
    "when I’m going to do it — as soon as I can get it done.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, millions of Americans got the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\n",
    "My message for you is this: You still have a high degree of protection.  Our \n",
    "doctors and scientists are working day and night to analyze the data from those \n",
    "two organizations on whether and when you need a booster shot.  And we’ll \n",
    "provide updates for you as the process moves ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the bottom line is: If you’re fully vaccinated, you’re highly protected \n",
    "from severe illness even if you get COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, recent data indicates there’s only one confirmed positive case per \n",
    "5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day.  You’re as safe as possible.  You’re \n",
    "in good shape.  And we’re doing everything we can to keep it that way, which is \n",
    "where the booster comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let me be clear: Yes, we’ve made incredible progress in vaccinating \n",
    "Americans, with over 182 million people being fully vaccinated as of today.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.  And it’s caused by the fact that, \n",
    "despite Americans having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, \n",
    "despite the fact that for almost five months, free vaccines have been available \n",
    "in 80,000 locations, we still have — we still have over 70 million Americans who\n",
    "have failed to get a single shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to \n",
    "undermine with false information the fight against COVID-19.  This is totally \n",
    "unacceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing.  Three quarters of the\n",
    "eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter has not gotten any.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in a country as large as ours, that’s — 25 percent minority can cause an \n",
    "awful lot of damage.  And they are causing a lot of damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and \n",
    "intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or a \n",
    "cancer operation needed to get the lifesaving care because the places where they\n",
    "would get that care are crowded; they are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unvaccinated also put our economic at — recovery at risk, causing unease in \n",
    "the economy around the — and causing unease around the kitchen table.  I can \n",
    "imagine what’s going on in the conversations this morning, and a lot of parents \n",
    "wondering what’s going to happen.  “What’s going to happen?”  Those who have \n",
    "been vaccinated — “what’s going to happen?”  Potentially slowing economic \n",
    "growth, costing jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their refusal has cost all of us.  The refusal to get vaccinated has cost all of\n",
    "us.  And I’m moving forward with vaccination requirements wherever I can.  These\n",
    "requirements will cover two thirds of all workers in America. \n",
    "\n",
    "And I’m pleased to see more businesses and organizations instituting their own \n",
    "vaccination requirements.  I’ve had business leaders call me and thank me for \n",
    "setting the policies that would allow them to do the same thing.  They are able \n",
    "to do it anyway, but it gives them the ability to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re making progress.  For example, United Airlines, which required vaccines \n",
    "about seven weeks ago, now has 97 percent of their employees vaccinated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just four weeks ago, the Department of Defense required vaccinations for the \n",
    "military, and already 92 percent — 92 percent — of our active-duty service \n",
    "members are vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we’re on track to administer 24 million shots in arms in September. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, please, do the right thing.  Do the right thing.  And I understand there’s a\n",
    "lot of misinformation you’ve been fed out there, but try to look through — get \n",
    "to people you trust, the people who have been vaccinated.  Ask them.  Ask them. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, get vaccinated.  But just don’t take it from me.  Listen to the voices of \n",
    "the unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds, taking their final \n",
    "breaths, saying — and, literally, we’ve seen this on television — “If only I had\n",
    "gotten vaccinated.  If only.  If only.”\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re leaving behind husbands and wives and small children — people who adore \n",
    "them.  People are dying and will die who don’t have to die.  It is not hyperbole\n",
    "to suggest it’s literally a tragedy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please don’t let this become your tragedy.  Get vaccinated.  It can save your \n",
    "liv- — your life.  It can save the lives of those around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, text your ZIP Code to 438829 — 438829 — or visit Vaccines.gov to find \n",
    "a vaccination location near you now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me close with this: We also made so much progress during the past eight \n",
    "months in this pandemic, and now we face a critical moment.  We have the tools. \n",
    "We have the plan.  We just have to finish the job together as one nation.  And I\n",
    "know we can.  I know we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "God bless you all.  And please, look out for your own self-interest and health \n",
    "here.  Get vaccinated.  May God protect our troops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC, Rachel Scott.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q  Thank you, Mr. President.  You said on the campaign trail that you were going\n",
    "to restore the moral standing of the U.S., that you were going to immediately \n",
    "end Trump’s assault on the dignity of the immigrant communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given what we saw at the border this week, have you failed in that promise?  And\n",
    "this is happening under your watch.  Do you take responsibility for the chaos \n",
    "that’s unfolding?\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Of course I take responsibility.  I’m President.  But it was \n",
    "horrible what — to see, as you saw — to see people treated like they did: horses\n",
    "nearly running them over and people being strapped.  It’s outrageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "I promise you, those people will pay.  They will be — an investigation is \n",
    "underway now, and there will be consequences.  There will be consequences.  It’s\n",
    "an embarrassment.  But beyond an embarrassment, it’s dangerous; it’s wrong.  It \n",
    "sends the wrong message around the world.  It sends the wrong message at home.  \n",
    "It’s simply not who we are.  Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter Alexander.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q    Mr. President, thank you.  You came into office on a message of competence \n",
    "and unity.  We’ve witnessed what’s happened in the country over the course of \n",
    "the last several months.  We’ve seen the chaotic troop withdrawal from \n",
    "Afghanistan, the threat of a government shutdown right now, and Democrats — \n",
    "members of your own party — are still divided over your agenda going forward.  \n",
    "So what do you say to Americans who say that you have not delivered on that \n",
    "promise?\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Remember, I said it’s going to take me a year to deliver \n",
    "everything I’m looking at here.  That’s number one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number two, take a look at what I inherited when I came into office — when I \n",
    "came into office, the state of affairs, and where we were: We had 4 million \n",
    "people vaccinated.  We had no plan.  We had — I mean, I can go down the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you know, part of it is dealing with the panoply of things that were landed \n",
    "on my plate.  I’m not complaining; it’s just a reality.  It’s a reality, number \n",
    "one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number two, I think a part of what has to happen here as well — for example, \n",
    "let’s talk about my economic plan.  The economic plan — and you all are always —\n",
    "and understandably, legitimately — citing polls.  Every element of my economic \n",
    "plan is overwhelmingly popular — overwhelmingly popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem is, with everything happening, not everybody knows what’s in \n",
    "that plan.  For example, all those women out there who are not able to go back \n",
    "to work because they have a — a dependent grandparent or a parent, or they have \n",
    "a dependent child who needs help, or they can’t find daycare, or they can’t find\n",
    "affor- — I mean, look at what’s happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there’s a solution.  There’s a solution in the proposal that I put \n",
    "forward.  And the plans we’re now debating in the United St- — among ourselves \n",
    "and they’re debating in Congress as — is a plan — the essence of the plan that I\n",
    "laid out at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, I’m confident that, at the end of the day, we’re going to be able to get\n",
    "that done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second point I’d like to make: We talk about price tags.  The — it is zero price\n",
    "tag on the debt.  We’re paying — we’re going to pay for everything we spend.  So\n",
    "they say it’s not — you know, people, understandably — “Well, you know, it \n",
    "started off at $6 trillion, now it’s $3.5 trillion.  Now it’s — is it going to \n",
    "be $2.9?  Is it…”\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s going to be zero — zero.  Because in the — in that plan that I put forward \n",
    "— and I said from the outset — I said, “I’m running to change the dynamic of how\n",
    "the economy grows.” \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m tired of trickle-down.  The trillionaires and billionaires are doing very, \n",
    "very well — you all know it; you’ve all reported it — and in the middle of this \n",
    "crisis.  But hardworking people and middle-class people are getting hurt. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so, I provide for, for example, a tax cut.  If you have a child, you get a \n",
    "refundable tax credit.  It’s reduced hunger in America by 40 percent, literally,\n",
    "for children.  You have the — the whole notion of being able to provide for \n",
    "daycare for your children, getting people back to school, et cetera.  It’s all \n",
    "paid for. It’s all paid for. \n",
    "\n",
    "But — and a lot of these are flat tax cuts that exist within my proposal, and \n",
    "they’re being calculated as if the cost of — of the — of the Child Care Tax \n",
    "Credit is a cost to the government; it’s not.  It’s reducing taxes — reducing \n",
    "taxes, not increasing taxes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, part of the problem is I had hoped — I hadn’t planned on, although I kind \n",
    "of anticipated it might happen — I hadn’t planned on the 178-mile top winds \n",
    "hurricanes going into Louisiana and 20 inches of rain in New York and New \n",
    "Jersey, and — and an area as big as the state of New Jersey burning down in the \n",
    "West. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so, what I had hoped I would be doing, I do what I did in the campaign: I’d \n",
    "be out making the case about what my plan proposal contained.  And it’s been \n",
    "very much curtailed by a whole range of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, I think that it’s understandable — I think it’s understandable — people \n",
    "being frustrated.  I think they’re frustrated as well by the fact that — not \n",
    "just members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans — frustrated by, you know, \n",
    "“I thought this was going to be better.  I thought everything was working out.” \n",
    "We were — we were moving along on — on COVID-19, and now we have all these \n",
    "people who refuse to get a shot.  And now look at the people dying — large \n",
    "numbers of people dying.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I guess, I think it’s a totally legit- — obviously, it’s a legitimate \n",
    "question you’ve asked — but I think, putting into context here, it’s going to \n",
    "take some time here. \n",
    "\n",
    "And I know I always kid you when you all ask me about, “Well, what about — are \n",
    "you going to get A done, B done, C done?”  “Well,” I say, “do you want to \n",
    "negotiate?”  I’m being a bit facetious, obviously, but here’s the deal: This is \n",
    "going to end up — I believe, we’re going to end up getting both pieces of my \n",
    "economic legislation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first piece — the 1.9 — fundamentally changed the structure and the nature \n",
    "of the economy in this country, even though, remember, it got clobbered.  It was\n",
    "this — “Oh, this terrible thing, no Republican voted for it.”  Well, we got ec- \n",
    "— real economic growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it — we’re at this stalemate at the moment.  And we’re going to have to get \n",
    "these two pieces of legislation passed.  Both need to be passed.  And they’ll \n",
    "have a profound impact according to not just Joe — not Joe Biden, but according \n",
    "to Wall Street, according to the IMF, according to international organizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so — and then there’s, you know, I’m going to be having a meeting today with\n",
    "the Quad, with the — the leaders of — the leader of India, Japan, and Australia.\n",
    "And we’re going to be talking about Afghanistan, which is a legitimate thing for\n",
    "people to talk about. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the truth of the matter is, at the end of the day is: We were spending $300 \n",
    "million a day for 20 years.  There was no easy way to end that.  And we’re now \n",
    "still getting people out, but it’s — it’s really — there was no — no \n",
    "picture-book way to say, “Okay, the war has ended.  Let’s get everybody out, and\n",
    "we’ll go home.”  No war has ever ended that way, other than there’s been a \n",
    "surrender, and it’s a totally different circumstance. \n",
    "\n",
    "So anyway, there’s a lot, I’m sure, along the line that there are things I could\n",
    "have done better, but I make no apologies for my proposals, how I’m propo- — how\n",
    "I’m — how I’m proceeding, and why I think, by the end of the year, we’re going \n",
    "to be in a very different place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q    Mr. President, just to follow up on COVID, if I can, quickly —\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q    What do you say to Americans who disregard the new CDC guidance and get a \n",
    "booster shot anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I don’t — I’m not sure how they get it, but —\n",
    "\n",
    "Q    There are people who go into stores right now and just have got it without \n",
    "any high-risk situation or underneath that age limit; it happens around the \n",
    "country as we speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think what’s going to happen is you’re going to see \n",
    "that, in the near term — or we’re probably going to open this up anyway.  \n",
    "They’re constantly looking at — we’re looking at both Moderna and J&J.  And \n",
    "we’re both — as I said in the speech — in addition to that, we’re also looking \n",
    "to the time when we’re going to be able to expand the booster shots, basically, \n",
    "across the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I would just say: It’d be better to wait your turn in line, wait your — you \n",
    "know, in line — wait — wait your turn and to — to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q    Thank you, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Ken. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  When you met with congressional leaders this \n",
    "week, you told them to try to find a number less than $3.5 trillion on the \n",
    "reconciliation package that they could live with.  What is that topline number \n",
    "in your mind as you deliberate these considerations?\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, separately, you mentioned how you’re going to pay for some of these \n",
    "provisions.  Senator Wyden has a proposal on annual taxes on billionaires’ \n",
    "unrealized gains.  Is that a proposal that you support?\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I do.  I — look, I support a lot of these proposals.  We \n",
    "don’t need all the things I support to pay for this, but I do support that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, you — if you — if you get a — if you file with a W-2 form, you know, the \n",
    "IRS has access to your bank account and your bank tells you how much you made, \n",
    "what you have in there, and, you know — and they estimate your tax. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you — if you have no income, you’re just — it’s all — if you have no \n",
    "earned income and it’s all investment income, it’s hard to figure out what the \n",
    "hell you — excuse me — what the heck you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s why we have to — and I know some people don’t like this — that’s why \n",
    "we have to rehire some IRS agents.  And not to do anything, not to try to make \n",
    "people pay something they don’t owe — just say, “Hey, step up.  Step up and pay \n",
    "like everybody else does.\n",
    "\n",

If the string is not present in the tree, the output will be the same as the input. However, if the string is present in the tree, your task is to find the most common word to which it is a prefix and return that word instead (this can still turn out to be itself).\n",

Your autocomplete should then pass the following tests. As usual, add at least **three more test cases**, and explain why they are appropriate (you can use input other than Shakespeare for them).\n",

Your critical reflection needs to specifically evaluate the role of the different data structures used by their algorithm and what is the overall complexity that the algorithm offers. Can we do better? If so, how and by how much?\n",

    "    - Find the most frequent word in the list O(n) as the time complexity of the max function in Python is O(n), where n is the number of words with the same prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total time complexity is:\n",
    "T(n)= O(1)+O(1)+O(len(prefix))+O(len(prefix))+O(1)+O(n*len(longest word))+O(n) --> O(len(longest word) * n) as it is the biggest term in the equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the possible adjustments to the program might be using the Max Heap structure to find the most frequent word. However, insertion into the max heap for n words would take O(n log n) time, and retrieval of the maximum value would take O(1) time. In comparison with the time complexity of the max() function for retrieving the value from the list, it is more efficient to use it instead of creating a max heap data structure (O(n log n)>O(n)). Other autocomplete engines have the same time complexity as the implemented algorithm, so it is quite efficient."
