    "C. The schedular would check the dependencies of the tasks first. If there are none, the program will use heap structure to find the order of executed tasks. The values within every node would correspond to the priority points, assigned based on the time it takes to complete a task (representation of trying to finish more time-consuming tasks first), number of tasks that depend on the given task (to be more efficient and do required tasks first), the type of the task (for instance, academic activities have more priority than entertainment ones). Priority queues are appropriate data structures because they prioritize tasks first and then move to tasks with lower priority as humans do with their daily activities. Further, priority queues have similar actions as a usual schedular: inserting an element (adding an activity to a scheduler) and finding the element with the highest priority (doing the most urgent task).

    "A. The main changes in code will take place in the function run_task_scheduler. When the program uses the heappop  to extract the task with the highest priority, the code additionally checks whether the task can be multitasked. If so, the program needs to go through all other tasks in the current heap to check whether there are any activities that can be combined with the task. The program does not only check the top node of the heap but rather goes through all activities in the heap because all of them can be executed (they have no dependencies if they are in a heap). If the second activity is found, the loop terminates and executes both activities at the same time, taking the maximum time for two activities (e.g., if task 1 takes more time, its duration is added to the current time and vice versa). If the second activity for multitasking is not found, the program executes the first found task and continues its work. "

When the first extracted task is found to be multitaskable, the program goes through all tasks in a heap instead of checking only the top node because if two tasks can be at least partially be completed together, it is more time-efficient to not focus on priority. Further, there are some additions to function heappop as it needed adaptions to be able to extract nodes other than the top one. An additional argument will be added to the function, which specifies which node to execute, but by default, it would be set to 0. "

    "A. Using a scheduler makes a schedule more efficient because it rationally decides which order to execute tasks, instead of being spontaneous and doing tasks depending on human memory and other factors, such as distractions, unpredictable events, irrational decisions, etc. Furthermore, no additional time is required to decide what to do next or what can be multitasked, so the maximum utility is reached by doing tasks in a strict order. However, the scheduler has a limitation of not accounting for human factors and some basic human needs that were not uploaded to the scheduler but are necessary (brushing teeth, getting lunch/dinner, etc.). Another limitation of the scheduler is the lack of data adaptation. For instance, one of the tasks is to check the work hours of DMZ, but the visit itself might be planned at a time when it is closed. Similarly, the task of going to a barbeque with classmates requires an additional input of the most convenient time for everyone to go, which is considered in one of the subtasks but not used for actual scheduling."

I determine the efficiency of the schedule by looking at how many tasks were finished or started on that day, giving more priority to time-consuming tasks and ones with a deadline. Nevertheless, some entertainment activities might also make my schedule efficient if the day was a weekend or a break due to human nature. The reason for this is efficiency in terms of moral satisfaction is also essential."

I believe the best way to use the scheduler would be to plan certain parts of my day, like from morning to the afternoon, when I do not have many social activities or other possibly unexpected events. Further, it would be helpful to introduce break time between tasks to account for human tiredness after many activities. It is difficult for me to follow a specific schedule every day because I am not the most organized person, yet it would be an interesting experiment to carry out."
